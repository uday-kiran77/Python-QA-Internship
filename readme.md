## Test Android app using Test-ai-classifier

This project is designed to use artificial intelligence (AI) for picking items from the DOM in Android rather than traditional XPATH or ID, which may change during ongoing development. The test scripts created in the Agile Method of software development must be reused even after changes are made to the primary application. Using the same test scripts again after design modifications is therefore helpful.
